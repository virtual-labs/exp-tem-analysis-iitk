c.	A-4, B-2, C-3, D-1<br>
<b>d.	A-2, B-4, C-1, D-3</b><br>

2.Double side dimpling of sample has advantage of:<br>
a.	Providing very sharp and narrow region of observation<br>
<b>b.	Providing very shallow and wide region of observation</b><br>
c.	Minimised sample damage<br>
d.	Easier sample handling<br><br>

3.The nano-sized powders may be observed under TEM by which technique:<br>
<b>a.	Using few drops of powder-suspension on carbon coated copper grid</b><br>
b.	By conventional process of slicing, punching, dimpling, and ion beam milling<br>
c.	By putting nano-powders on copper grid<br>
d.	By making slurry/paste of powders on carbon coated copper grid<br><br>

4.The powder samples are suspended in the solution by:<br>
a)	Magnetic stirrer <br>
b)	Electric Heater<br>
c)	Gravity shaker <br>
<b>d)	Ultrasonication</b><br>

5.A nanocrystalline powder material is usually supported on TEM holder for TEM imaging:<br>
a.	Using copper grid<br>
b.	Dispersing on carbon tape<br>
c.	as stand-alone sample<br>
<b>d.	On carbon coated copper grid</b><br><br>

6.Brittle materials are prepared for TEM imaging using:<br>
<b>a.	Ion beam milling</b><br>
b.	Electrochemical Etching<br>
c.	Physical Vapor deposition<br>
d.	Disc-slicing<br><br>

7.Double side dimpling is preferred over one-sided dimpling because:<br>
a.	Double side dimpling has double efficiency of operation<br>
b.	Double side dimpling promotes less damage to material<br>
<b>c.	Double side dimpling provides more observable area for imaging</b><br>
d.	Double side dimpling reduces charging on the TEM sample
