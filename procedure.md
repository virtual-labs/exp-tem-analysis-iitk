POWDER SAMPLE:<br>
1)	Mill the powder sample into very fine size (orders of nm)<br>
2)	Suspend the powders in ethanol (alcohol medium)<br>
3)	Ultrasonicate to disperse the powder till a clear solution is obtained<br>
4)	Using a dropper, dispense few drops of suspension onto the carbon coated copper grid.<br>
5)	Please the grid on TEM sample holder for observation.<br>
<br>
BULK SAMPLE:<br><br>
1)	Take the bulk sample, and slice it into thickness of < 100 µm<br>
2)	Punch a 3 mm disc from the sheet<br>
3)	Use dimple grinder (either one side or both sides) to bring it down to thickness of 2-5 µm<br>
4)	Use electrochemical etching for getting a perforation on the sample<br>
5)	Follow it up (optional, or in place of electrochemical etching) with ion-beam milling.<br>
6)	The entire sample can now be placed on TEM holder (and will not require a grid for support).<br><br>

BRITTLE SAMPLE:<br>
1)	Crush the brittle material and follow the powder process. Here a copper grid (with or without carbon coating) will be needed.<br>
2)	For observing bulk sample, the grinding of the sample should be done to bring it down to < 100 µm thickness.<br>
3)	Now punch the 3 mm disc from the sheet.<br> 
4)	Use dimple grinder for thinning it down to 2-5 µm.<br>
5)	Use ion-beam milling process for getting a thin region (electron transparent) for observation under TEM. The entire sample can be used stand alone (without any support grid) for imaging.
